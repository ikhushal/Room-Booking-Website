A multispectral image captures information across
various spectral bands, providing valuable insights beyond the
visible spectrum. This paper explores the application of Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of
multi-spectral images and includes a comprehensive error
analysis of the transformed images. The experiment reveals the
effectiveness of PCA in handling large datasets and emphasizes its
significance in remote sensing applications.
